matometer
================

There was a really nice service @ 27c3 :
Just call M-A-T-E (dect 6283) and whisle with your bottle of mate leads to 
automated matefill repord.
Since there was no sourcecode for it, I did some research with the help of 
some mate drinking people and found some simple equotations yielding the 
matefill of the whisle-frequency.
